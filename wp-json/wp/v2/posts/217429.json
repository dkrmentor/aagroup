Let\u2019s go over the best SEO strategies for your edtech startup.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Users need valuable information&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to truly capture the interests of visitors online, then you need to focus on creating long and meaningful content as a part of your SEO strategy for your edtech startup. According to the most important SEO ranking variable, relevant long-form content is the way to go. You can increase the quality of your content and they stay time for users on your page. This tells Google that your website is valuable because people are spending time on it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Focus on your keyword strategy<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Keyword strategy is actually step one in your SEO marketing journey. Once you have created valuable content for your users it is time to focus on the right keyword strategy for SEO optimisation. To optimise your SEO strategy it is advised to use medium-tail keywords for your website. This means staying clear of common or obvious phrases because they are excessively used by everyone. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Till now you must have heard about marketing gurus advocating long-tail keywords for SEO strategy. That was before Google announced they were using a machine learning algorithm called GoogleRankBrain to enhance search results. Medium tail keywords are usually short phrases consisting of 3-4 words and provide the best results for your SEO needs.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"313\" src=\"https:\/\/AA Group.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/seo-strategies.png\" alt=\"on page optimization\" class=\"wp-image-217430\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/AA Group.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/seo-strategies.png 1024w, https:\/\/AA Group.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/seo-strategies-980x300.png 980w, https:\/\/AA Group.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/seo-strategies-480x147.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Use on-page optimisation<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here you need to focus on the actual structure of the webpage and improving it. This SEO strategy can have tremendous benefits and it is something that is entirely in your hands. Common on-page SEO optimisation techniques include optimising the url of the page to incorporate keywords, using the alt attribute to ascribe relevant descriptions for images, updating the title tag of the page using relevant search terms and updating a page\u2019s meta tags such as the meta description.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Optimise for off-site SEO<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This refers to ways by which you optimize your website through external means. You can use multiple methods as a part of your SEO strategies like guest blogging, social media activity, influencer marketing and brand mentions of your edtech startup. One of the most important SEO strategies is using backlink strategy. Backlinks are one of the core ranking factors in Google and other major search engines. However, you need to target only well-respected publications when researching and building backlinks. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>High-quality backlink building as a part of your SEO strategy can involve reaching out to other websites and building relationships with webmasters, submitting websites to relevant web directories and promoting good content. Your overall link building strategy can also involve building internal links within your website. This is a reliable SEO strategy for your website and can not only boost your SEO but ensure visitors spend more time on your site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"313\" src=\"https:\/\/AA Group.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/international-seo.png\" alt=\"international seo\" class=\"wp-image-217431\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/AA Group.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/international-seo.png 1024w, https:\/\/AA Group.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/international-seo-980x300.png 980w, https:\/\/AA Group.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/international-seo-480x147.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. International SEO<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are thinking big, you need to optimise your SEO strategies for international SEO. International SEO ensure visitors from other countries speaking different languages can discover and see your content. You can target content by country or language choice or both. Some companies target users by using this as a part of SEO marketing by making separate marketplaces available for different countries. You can identify countries that are generating a lot of backlinks or traffic to your edtech website. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, you can set up an international SEO-friendly URL structure by including a subdirectory for each country on your main website or a separate website for each country. For language targeting, you can use Hreflang tags. You can also optimize your international SEO strategies by considering search engine preferences in every country. For example, Baidu occupies more than 60% market share in China and Yandex is preferred in Eastern European countries.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Local seo<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Local SEO strategies ensure local visitors are directed to your website whenever they search for relevant keywords. To deploy a local SEO strategy, you need to use medium-tail keywords as I have already explained above. In addition, you need to get your Google My Business listing and get more citations on websites where users post reviews. You can encourage users to post reviews of your edtech startup.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"internal-linking\" style=\"border: medium hidden; padding: 10px; background-color: #d8d8d8; color: #000000; text-align: center;\">See also: <a href=\"https:\/\/AA Group.com\/digital-marketing-strategies-for-edtech-companies\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><u> 10 Best Digital Marketing Strategies for EdTech Companies\n <\/u><\/a><\/i><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7.
